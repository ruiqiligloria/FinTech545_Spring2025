**Author:** Ruiqi Li  
**Course:** FinTech 545 

## Files  
- `545hw1.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing code and results  
- `545hw1_ruiqili.pdf` – PDF summary of results and analysis

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, SciPy, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Instructions  
1. Open `545hw1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the notebook sequentially to generate results.  
3. Refer to `545hw1_ruiqili.pdf` for a concise summary.  

## Results Overview  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Data fits both normal and t-distributions well.  
- **Covariance Matrix Adjustment:** Higham and Rebonato-Jackel methods used.  
- **Time Series Models:** ARMA(3,0) chosen based on AICc.  
- **Simulation Methods:** Cholesky maintains covariance structure better but is slower than PCA.
